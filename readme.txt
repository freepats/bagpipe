Bagpipe
-------

Version 2022-12-04

Samples recorded on August 2020 by Gilles Sadowski, on a bagpipe in G designed
by RÃ©my Dubois and built by Olle Geris. Sennheiser MKE2 Gold microphone and
Audacity software on a GNU/Linux laptop. All recordings were done while
standing at about 80 cm from the microphone.

This bagpipe has a range from F4 to G6 and 2 drones (the pipes which produce a
constant background sound). The drones were recorded separatedly and can be
played on the octaves 2 and 3. They are tuned to G in the original instrument,
so G2 corresponds to the lower drone and G3 the higher one. Other notes in the
octaves 2 and 3 will play the drones transposed.

This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is available on the
FreePats project web pages: http://freepats.zenvoid.org/
